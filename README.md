## Description

Easily share secrets in parts and reconstruct them again from
an minimum amount of parts.

If you ever came to the idea that you want to split, say, a password, a secret or anything alike into parts to, for example, hand them out to family members/friends, or print and hide them but you could forget the location of a view pieces, they get lost, or you want that an specific amount of said friends are able to reconstruct the secret, you can use this program to choose a minimum amount of pieces from a total with which youre able to get your secret back.
Even more its possible to GPG encrypt/sign it directly from within.

GUI Copyright (C) 2020  Ned84 ned84@protonmail.com

The Shares are created using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.

Optional it is possible to use GPG encryption and signing.

## Manual

### Status Bar

The status bar is the bar on the botton of the GUI.
There will be the output for diagnostic and error messages.

### Creating Shares

To create shares from a file of your choice, first click on the "Create" tab and choose the file you want to split into shares with the Load button.

![Load File](https://github.com/Ned84/2plus2eq5/blob/master/Screenshots/twotwofive_load_file_GUI.png)

Choose the encryption level of your choice.
If you leave it on Default, the lowest possible encryption level will be chosen.
More information on the encryption level [here.](#encryption-level)

Increase or decrease the Minimum Shares and Total Shares as you wish.
The Total Shares are the amount of shares youll create in total.
The Minimum Shares are the amount of shares youll need at least to reconstruct your file e.g:

```If you want to split a secret into 10 parts but want to be able to reconstruct it from only 5 or more of this parts```
```the correct input would be:```

```Total shares: 10 ```

```Minimum Shares: 5```

When you are done choosing the above, you can start the share creation with the Start button.

If you chose to use GPG it will create a .asc file in the same directory as your chosen file with the signed, encrypted or signed/encrypted data.
More on how to enable GPG encryption/signing [here.](#gpg-presettings)

After the Shares are created the status bar will show "Shares successfully created".

The creation of the shares will create a folder in the same directory as your chosen file with the name "Shares".
In it you will find the shares and a Overview.txt which contains important information on how to reconstruct the file again.

**You should keep this file as safe as your shares and/or hand it out to people you want to be able to reconstruct it with their shares.**

After the creation is done, the File explorer will pop up and show you the newly created folder.

Beware that files in the Share folder and if you use GPG encryption/signing any old .asc used for splitting will be overwritted/deleted.
So if you want to split a few files after another, save the shares and overview.txt in another location after each splitting.


### Combining Shares
To combine the shares again you first need to check the Overview.txt you hopefully kept safely.
The important information written there are the encryption level used to create the shares (which we will use to combine them again), the minimum amount of shares you need to reconstruct and finally the original file name of the splitted file.

![Combine_GUI](https://github.com/Ned84/2plus2eq5/blob/master/Screenshots/twotwofive_Combine_Gui.png)

First click on the "Combine" tab and choose the Minimum Shares as written in the Overview.txt.

Next choose the shares for reconstruction with the Load button.
The amount of shares have to be at least as many as the minimum shares chosen.

![Load Shares](https://github.com/Ned84/2plus2eq5/blob/master/Screenshots/twotwofive_load_shares_GUI.png)

As you can see youre able to (and have to) choose multiple shares at once.
To be able to do this save all your shares in one location.

Next choose the encryption level as written in the Overview.txt.
More information on the encryption level [here.](#encryption-level)
If you choose another encryption level or less "minimum shares" than used to create the shares, it wont be able to reconstruct the file or the file will be broken.

When you are done to choose the settings as written in the Overview.txt and loaded your shares you are able to start the reconstruction with the Start button.

This will create a "Combined_Shares.txt" in the directory of your previously loaded shares.

If the reconstructed file is gpg encrypted it will create a "Combined_Shares.txt.asc".
In this case you need to first decrypt/verify the .asc before changing the filename to the original one.

More on how to enable GPG encryption/signing [here.](#gpg-presettings)

Next rename the file to the original filename written in the Overview.txt.

Voil√† you reconstructed your file.


### Encryption Level

The encryption level is a Mersenne primenumber wich will be chosen on the size (bitlength) of the file you want to split into shares.
You are able to increase it but going lower than the minimum needed will break the splitted files.

Be aware that increasing the encryption level can dramasticly add to the time it will take to create the shares.
The time is dependent on the encryption level, the minimum shares chosen and the size of the file you want to split itself.

If you try for example to split a .zip with many files inside, with a high encryption level and a high minimum shares needed, it can take very long to create the shares (even if it will finish eventually).

The minimum available encryption level i chose to be 521 which should be sufficient for smaller files.


### GPG Presettings

It is possible to use gpg signing and encryption directly from withing this program.
I wont go into further detail how gpg works.
It is preinstalled on most Linux distros. For Windows etc you can get it from [here.](https://gnupg.org/)

You are able to turn on encryption and/or signing in the Settings window.

![General_Settings](https://github.com/Ned84/2plus2eq5/blob/master/Screenshots/twotwofive_General_Settings.png)

In the GPG settings you are able to choose the location of your keyring and which keys to use.

![GPG_Settings](https://github.com/Ned84/2plus2eq5/blob/master/Screenshots/twotwofive_GPG_Settings.png)

The presetting for the keyring location is the default location of gnupg.
You can change this as needed.
Beware that if you try to open a different location for the keyring, it will only change if this location contains a pubring.kbx file,
otherwise it will remain on the old directory.

Choose the Public key for encryption and the signing key for signing.

The steps of creating shares will stay the same, except if you chose GPG signing and you press the Start button, you will be prompted with the input window for the GPG password.
Enter it for your key and it will sign the file prior encrypting and/or splitting.


### Auto Update

If you want to be informed when a new release is online and use the update functionality enable the Auto Update in the Settings.
Otherwise the Update window will show "No connection to Github"

### Best Practices
* Most important after each split try to reconstruct the file again right away to ensure that the information in the Overview.txt is correct and the splitting was successful. Dont split and hope that everything went correct only to find out much later that it didnt work.

* If you want to split sensitive data it would be best to do so in a linux distro without internet connection. If you want to go one step further do this on a live distro on an USB.

* I have to press again that i wont take any responsibility for dataloss so ensure to get comfortable with the program and the splitting and reconstruction process.

## Support

If you require help or if you have suggestions please refer to the [Issue section](https://github.com/Ned84/2plus2eq5/issues).

## Verify Signatures

### Windows

Download the sha256sum.txt and the .asc for your TwoTwoFive version.

#### Basic checksum verification

In Powershell:

```(Get-FileHash .\TwoTwoFive*.*_setup.exe).Hash -eq (Get-Content .\sha256sum.txt).split(" ")[0].ToUpper()```

should show:

```True```

#### Signature verification

The programm is signed with my signature which windows checks when you run the TwoTwoFive setup.

It should state **"Open Source Developer, Rene Mario Baumgartner"** as Verified Publisher.

### Linux

Download the sha256sum.txt and the .asc for your TwoTwoFive version.

#### Basic checksum verification:

```shasum -a 256 -c sha256sum.txt```

should show:

```TwoTwoFive_V*.*.tar.xz: OK```

#### GPG verification

```curl https://keybase.io/ned84/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import```

and verify with:

```gpg --verify TwoTwoFive_V*.*.tar.xz.asc```

should show:

```Good signature from "Ned84 <ned84@protonmail.com>"```
